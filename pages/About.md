I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Design, Architecture and Building Faculty of the University of Technology Sydney. My research focuses on developing Queer strategies for designing VR experiences, with a focus on embodiment and the interface between bodies and virtual worlds.

I also currently teach in the Visual Communication course. I graduated from the Visual Communications (Honours) course at UTS in 2018, after completing a combined Viscom + International Studies degree.
